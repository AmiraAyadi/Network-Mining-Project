March 3, 2011Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depth—his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,Cody,
Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr,hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Please find below a status report on Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi.
Thanks.
TimStatus update on the Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi:
The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off
shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the
situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.
He will be accompanied by a DS team, a staff member from Embassy Tripoli and the leader of USAID's DART team. With
the support of Ambassador Cretz and Embassy Tripoli, Mr Stevens is in contact with TNC members on the ground in
Benghazi and elsewhere; the team is also in contact with other diplomatic missions and NGOs in Benghazi. We expect to
get support in particular from the Turks who have a consulate in Benghazi.
Mr. Stevens team has been in touch with Africom planners on the details of the mission. We have made the official
request for support from OSD but have yet to get approval. Once we have that — and we hope that will be very soon --
we will be able to move forward with the planning.

According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over
Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate is now a
Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.
Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch.
I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt

Libya's Rebels
Pm Just Speaking For Myself, Former President Says
By SUZAN CLARICE
April 3, 2011 —
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he thinks the United States should consider arming the rebels in Libya's
civil war.
""It would depend ... and I might need to know a little more, but I would be inclined to do it,"" Clinton told
correspondent Bianna Golodryga today in San Diego during an exclusive interview with ABC News.
Clinton was in San Diego for his annual Clinton Global Initiative University Meeting.
The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East.
Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader
Col. Moamrnar Gadhafi's forces, which are better equipped.
Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks
on civilians from Gadhafiss troops in the air.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr,cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

,There is probably no greater Islamic authority for sunni muslims than him (there are actually a few of them, but he's the
oldest). And they don't do this often.
,RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Ara.bia's Grand Mufti, the highest religious authority in the birthplace of Islam, on
Saturday denounced attacks on diplomats and embassies as un-Islamic after deadly protests against a U.S.-made
film mocking Islam's founder.
Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al al-Sheikh also called on governments and international bodies to
criminalise insults against prophets and excoriated the film that has prompted a wave of fury across the Middle
East.
""It is forbidden to punish the innocent for the wicked crimes of the guilty, or to attack those who have been
granted protection of their lives and property, or to expose public buildings to fire or destruction,"" he said in a
speech carried by state news agency SPA.
Describing the release of the crudely made short film as ""miserable"" and ""criminal"", he added that attacks on
the innocent and diplomats ""are also a distortion of the Islamic religion and are not accepted by God"".
At least nine people were killed after noon prayers on Friday in demonstrations across the Middle East.

By Margaret Talev on October 14, 2012
BusinessWeek
Bloomberg News
The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign.
""it would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue,"" Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis, California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack Obama for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.
The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
""The security matters are being adequately investigated,"" Stevens said. ""We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena."" Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.
'Very Optimistic'
Stevens said while he was close with his son, ""we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities' he undertook in
Libya. On the occasions when his son called home, Stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than
to say that ""he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government."" They last spoke by phone
in August and by e-mail days before his son's death.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr,cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign.
""It would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue,"" Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis. California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack ()barna for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.
The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
""The security matters are being adequately investigated,"" Stevens said. ""We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena,"" Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.",cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr,hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

150,2012-09-17T04:00:00+00:00,"BENGHAZI (Reuters) - An amateur video appears to show Libyans trying to rescue U.S. ambassador
Christopher Stevens from a room filled with smoke at the U.S. mission where he was found unconscious after
last week's attack by a mob protesting against a film that denigrates the Prophet Mohammad.
The video,, which appeared on the interne and a copy of which was obtained by Reuters in Benghazi,
confirms reports that suggested the U.S. envoy died of asphyxiation after the building caught fire.
The footage also sheds new light on the circumstances of the ambassador's death, apparently showing for the
first time that some of the people who forced their way into the U.S. compound later tried to rescue Stevens
after they found him lying alone, with no security detail, in one of the rooms in the building.
The video shows a group of young men who had earlier stormed the compound telling other protesters by the
light of torches and mobile phones that they had found someone who appeared to be a foreigner lying on the
floor.
""There is someone inside He is a foreigner, he is a foreigner. Take him out,"" said one man, shouting for
help.
""Bring him out, man! Bring him out,"" another said.
""The man is alive. Bring him out, man. Bring him out,"" said a third.
""Alive, Alive! God is Greatest,"" the crowd cried. Someone called for a car.
""Make space, is there someone who is a medic around? Anyone who can get a car quickly?"" another man can
be heard saying.
Stevens and three other embassy staff died when gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate and a safe house in the
eastern Libyan city on Tuesday night. The attackers were part of a crowd blaming America for a film they said
insulted the Prophet Mohammad.
Security personnel were separated from Stevens during the attack, U.S. officials said, in the chaos of smoke
and gunfire that ensued.
The identity and motive of the attackers remain unclear. Activists who took part in the protest said the
motive was rage at the video produced in California and which describes the Prophet as a homosexual and",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr,cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was

main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States

traveled with me. It was extremely productive. SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO member
and partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and
approved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts
both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom
touched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many
mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national
action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement
them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional
conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted
me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!
I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people
both at NATO and DOD.
I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting
the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.
I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards
of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.
In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in
Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out
of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss.

Published September 21, 2012
BENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the
compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building
Friday.
In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the
Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.
Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their
weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting ""No to militias.""
""I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to
see people in uniform,"" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which
protesters said was done in support of the army and police.
No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed
militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.
For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest
problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the
multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the
regular armed forces and police.
The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's
revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals
and carrying out killings.
Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their
hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which
killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist
militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were
wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.
Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on
Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.
""No, no, to militias,"" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that
militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. ""Benghazi is in a trap,""
signs read. ""Where is the army, where is the police?""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr,philippe.reines@univ-tlse3.fr

Before the attack, Egypt, Turkey, Sudan, Italy, Tunisia, France and the UN had rep there
France and the UN pulled out after 9/11
But the question being posed has a false premise, i.e. that the US depended on foreign militia while the others
depended on their own resources
The US had tertiary dependence on the militia, as our primary and secondary reliance was on first the OS personnel arid
the second on the QRF
The others did not have an internal second

By Nancy A. Youssef
McClatchy Newspapers
On the day of the attack, U.S. officials had spotted a police officer taking photos of the compound from a villa
under construction across the streets. This was the view the officer would have had of the compound.
- Nancy A. Youssef /MCT
Even before the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and
three other Americans, diplomats from other nations and Libyan security officials had questioned the wisdom of
a U.S. decision to rely primarily on members of a local militia to protect its compound here.
Diplomats here told McClatchy that while it's customary to depend on local forces to protect diplomatic
missions, only the United States of the 10 or so foreign missions here allowed the local militia to be the first line
of defense. The others said they instead depended on military forces from their own country to provide security.
""A few months ago, there was a small attack here and the Libyans fled,"" said a diplomat from a European
nation who asked that he not be further identified so that he could speak candidly about his assessment of
security here. ""After that, I decided to only use special forces"" from his own country.
""We never considered using the brigades,"" he said, referring to the 17th of February Brigade, the local militia
that was considered the primary security force for the U.S. mission. ""We assumed the United States had a
special relationship with the brigades.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr,cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

SOURCE. Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services,
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime
Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jalil engaged in a series of
emergency planning meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of
the new National Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive
sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of
disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the
regime of Muammar al Qadclafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These
individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry
militiamen came to el-ICeib's office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support
for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi advisors from the new
government.",jake.sullivan@univ-tlse3.fr sulliyanfostate.gott@univ-tlse3.fr,hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

CdmMills, Cheryl D; Lindwall, David E; Merten, Kenneth H; B61
As Haiti enters the period of electoral contestation, it is essential that all political actors remain
calm and encourage their supporters to do the same. The United States, together with Haiti's
international community partners, stands ready to support efforts to thoroughly review irregularities
in support of electoral results that are consistent with the will of the Haitian people expressed in
their votes.
Like others, the Government of the United States is concerned by the Provisional Electoral
Council's announcement of results from the November 28 national elections that are inconsistent
with the published results of the National Election Observation Council (CNO), which had more
than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide, election-day
observations by official U.S. observers accredited by the CEP, and vote counts observed around the
country by numerous domestic and international observers.
Haiti's transition to democracy over the past 24 years has seen many successes, overcoming major
challenges. The 2010 elections represent a critical test of whether the Haitian people will
determine their destiny through their vote. The United States is committed to the consolidation of
democracy in Haiti and calls on the Government of Haiti, the CEP and all political forces to ensure
that the will of the people is fully reflected in the outcome of this election.

FyiSenator DeMint is insisting that he and Sujay sit down to personally review her post-hearing QFR answers. This is highly
unusual. We offered Sujay up right away, but DeMint's staff insisted that the Senator was only available to meet on
December 16 (the Senate target adjournment date is December 17). This effectively scuttles any chance Sujay has of
getting confirmed this Congress.
Unfortunately, we don't have much recourse. Sujay's nomination will remain on Tuesday's business meeting agenda, but
given his request, DeMint will exercise his prerogative and ask that she be held over. With no other business meetings
scheduled this year, she'll remain stuck in Committee.
There's another factor at play here too. We learned yesterday afternoon that Sujay has taken it upon herself to reach out
to different Senator's offices. I don't know what exactly she's been saying, but the leg officer (a State Department fellow)
handling Sujay's nomination got an email from Hatch's office. He has been supportive of her and we have a good working
relationship with them. I don't know what Sujay said, but the message back from Hatch's person is that ""while we do
support her, this really makes us question her common sense and judgment."" We obviously told her to stop her outreach
campaign.
Finally, Hatch's office also informed us that Brownback is rumored to be considering a hold on Sujay's nomination if
DeMint for any reason relents.What is the state of play?CherylScheduled for next Thursday at 1:45pm. It is a staff-only meeting.
FYI — We've also heard that Brownback might cause trouble too.
